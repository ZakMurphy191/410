                    <p> I am Country boy that is the baby of the family from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.I have
                        a family of five one brother named Tyler, my mom and dad, as well as my dog named
                        gunner. Gunner is a weimaraner who loves to go on walks. My main hobbies I like to

                    <p>I also like to help out my community and participate in cleaning roads, getting food
                        to the poor, and all of the above to make sure everyone else is safe. If I were to
                        describe myself with a quote I believe my personality is best represented by the
                        saying "Be strong but not rude, be kind but not weak, be humble but not timid, be
                        proud but not arrogant."</p>

                    <p>Out of all of my hobbies i find the most interest in dirt biking, as I am a Monster
                        Energy Kawasaki professional rider. I am honored to be where I am in the racing
                        world, but i do think that all my hard work and time paid off in it. I get to travel
                        the world and race dirt bikes while being paid. So I would like to give you some
                        advice, if you really want to do something, do it and do not look back! </p>
